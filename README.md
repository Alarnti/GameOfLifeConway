# GameOfLifeConway
Implementation of the popular game in Ruby with Rspec

You can play by 'ruby main.rb' command in src folder.
Then please choose 'input.txt' file, because there are coordinates for a single Gosper's Glider Gun creating "gliders".

Indentation is horrible, sorry. It is all because of my text editor. Unfortunately, I have noticed that indentation too late, only after 3-4 commits.
(Tab should contain only 2 spaces, but here, I suppose, 4)
